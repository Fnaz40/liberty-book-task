    <h4 id="margin">DESCRIPTION</h4>
    <P>Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne,
        Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official
        Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West
        End on 30th July 2016. It was alwamnys difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he
        is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.
        While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must
        struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both
        father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places. <br>

    <P>The most exciting and wonderful read after all the years. This book has the most charismatic characters
        I've ever met. Rowling had given a wonderful and splendid ending to the Harry Potter series.</P>
    <strong>Maya</strong> 22/08/2016
    <p>While the prose lacks the rich descriptions that distinguish Rowling's writing, the amiable characters
        (Scorpius Malfoy), reminiscent of the young Golden Trio will make this play feel familiar to die-hard
        fans of the original Harry Potter series.</p>

        ALL MAJOR SPOILERS ARE HIDDEN.

        Ok, I actually went into this with zero spoilers and very few expectations so that I'd enjoy whatever it turned
        out to be. I mean, I like scripts. Harry Potter is my life. We're good. So I really tried not to compare this to
        the HP books or look at it as an intense f... <a href="text"> ...more</a>

        3 1/2 stars. I completely get why many HP fans will be disappointed with this, but I have to admit: I really
        enjoyed it. I'd love to see this story play out on stage.
    </p>
    <p> So yeah, I understand the sad feelings. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a completely different vibe.

        It was alright. It was just alright.
    </p>
    <p>I know I gave this 4 stars, but to be honest, J.K. Rowling can write a dictionary with Harry Potter
        illustrations
        and I'd probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias.

        You know, I really hadn’t foreseen the publication of something to lengthen Harry Potter’s story after the
        conclusion that was <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.</em>
    </p>
    <p> So, the way I see it, <em>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</em> is a lovely gift to every Harry Potter fan

    <p> Now this was a real shame. It read like some juvenile fan fiction. The characters were utterly lifeless. Perhaps
        seeing this would be better. The stage actor’s performances would carry the emotion and drama the dialogue
        completely failed to convey.

    <p>Final official review of the script and the play:
        I've read the book first. You can't expect me to wait 4 days and not read a book that has the name J. K. Rowling
        on it.

        I've waited for this particular story for what feels like ages, and words cannot even describe for how grateful
        I am that it finally exists in my hands. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world

        RULE FOR SPOILERS: if it's in the first 10%, and therefore (in most cases) available for scrutiny from undecided
